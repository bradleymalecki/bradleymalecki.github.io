    <h5>How This All Works</h5>
    <p>
      This is a pretty simple process. Atom is a text editing software that was created by the people at github and allows you to actually type in the words to build your website. github is a place where someone can store and save their coded sites in a cloud for accsess anywhere by using a repository. github Desktop allows someone to connect and sync the website they create with Atom, and sync it with their repository on github on their account.
