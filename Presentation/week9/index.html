<h1>Easy - critiquing the characters</h1>
<p>
  Already explained it to the group my brotha, if you werent there for that, then its your loss
</p>

<h1>Medium - Feeback for the group</h1>
<ul>
  <li> My perfered method of Communication is through HTML posted to my github </li>
  <li>1. Too short - I think the presentation could have been longer. I throughly enjoyed the presentation and wish I could have recived more knowlage from your beautiful mouths.  </li>
  <li>2. To small paper cards - I found the small hard to handle and read. I lost my card 30 times before I actually had a chance to actually read it. I think it may be better if the cards were bigger and had a bigger font. </li>
  <li>3. Thats it - I dont want to give feedback where the group does not need it just for feed back sake! I was going to put a joke here about how the Chicken love website made me uncomfterble, but that would be unessecary so i did not! </li>
</ul>
